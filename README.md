## Introduction
Between 2005 and 2008, our business moved fast, products sold, revenue flowed, and customer behavior evolved. But somewhere along the line, we started asking some uncomfortable questions:
- Are we really doing as well as we think?
- Which products are actually driving our success?
- Are our customers loyal, or just polite?
- And most importantly… is Canada even trying?

This project takes a close look at four years of sales and customer data. We built a dashboard that helps answer these questions and gives us a clearer picture of where we were doing well and where we could improve.

## The Problem: Data Without Direction
We had numbers. Plenty of them.  
What we didn’t have was clarity.  
Revenue figures, customer records, product lists—all scattered and flat. Reports looked like they were made for robots, not decision-makers.  
So, the question wasn’t “What did we sell?” It was: **“What’s the story behind the numbers?”**

## Executive Summary: What the Data Told Us

### Revenue at a Glance
We brought in **$29.36 million** over four years.  
That sounds good on paper. But looking closer, we saw more than just growth.  
In 2005, our monthly revenue barely grew. By 2008, we were hitting over **$800K per month**. That’s real progress.

### From 1,013 to 60,000 Customers: A Journey of Growth, Profit, and Sustainability

In just four years, the business transformed from humble beginnings. In 2005, we started with **1,013 customers**—a small but steady base. By 2008, that number exploded to **60,000 customers**, each playing a part in our rapid expansion.

But growth isn’t just about numbers. It’s about what those numbers mean. Over this period, we generated a total **profit of $12.1 million**, yielding a **profit margin of 41.15%**.

This wasn’t just about growth for the sake of it. Every step was carefully planned to ensure we could sustain that growth, turning new customers into long-term supporters. It wasn’t just about getting bigger; it was about getting smarter and more efficient, building a strong foundation for the future.
 

### Where the Money Came From:
- **The U.S.** was our biggest source of revenue, with various regions showing different results.
- **Australia** did well, though quietly.
- **The UK, France, and Germany** contributed solid numbers.
- **Canada?** It picked up speed in the later years.

### Products That Performed:
Some products did well right out of the gate, while others barely sold.
- **Road-150 Red, 48** generated over **$1.2M** in revenue. It was a big hit.
- On the other hand, **Road-650 Red, 62** only sold **16 units** in four years. It definitely wasn’t a bestseller.
- **The highest-selling product by quantity** was **Water Bottle - 30 oz**, which sold over **4244 units** across the years.

### The Customers Behind the Sales:
- **Total number of customers**: Over **100,000** customers were part of the sales journey, with a significant portion of them being repeat buyers.
- **Top customers by revenue**: The **top 10 customers** alone generated over **$132,035** in sales and surprisingly, all of them were from **France**.
- **Top customers by quantity**: The **top 10 customers by quantity** had a strong purchasing frequency, though they were not the same customers who generated the highest revenue.

- **Customers aged 55+** were our most consistent buyers.
- The **35–45 age group** seemed less engaged.
- **Most customers?** They were repeat buyers.
- **Canada** bought in bulk, while **France** favored precision and quality.

This gives us two very different approaches to how we market our products in these regions.

## What We Learned
- **Revenue ≠ Profit.** Selling more doesn’t always mean making more money.
- One strong product can carry a weak lineup—at least for a while.
- **Older customers tend to spend more.** We should cater to their needs.
- **Loyalty is key.** Keep your repeat customers happy—they’re your best bet.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – for creating the interactive dashboard
- **DAX** – for custom calculations and insights
- **Excel** – for cleaning and preparing the data

## Project Breakdown: Sales & Regional Insights

The goal of this project wasn’t just to create something pretty to look at, but to give us real answers to important business questions. We analyzed four years of data to understand where our revenue was coming from, how our customers were behaving, and what was driving our success.

### Sales Performance:
We wanted to know which products and regions were making the biggest impact on our revenue. This meant looking closely at how sales grew month by month, and which products stood out. By identifying our top-performing products, we could focus on what was working.

### Customer Behavior:
We also examined customer behavior, breaking down details like age groups and repeat purchasing habits. This helped us understand which customers were the most valuable and how we could tailor our marketing efforts to different groups. For example, we found that older customers tended to spend more, which means we could offer them specialized products or services.

### Regional Insights:
A major finding was how different regions performed. The U.S. led the way in revenue, but different areas within the U.S. had different sales patterns. Some parts did better than others. This kind of breakdown helped us understand where we could improve and where to focus our efforts. For example, Australia had a strong showing, while Canada took a few years to catch up. Temperature patterns also played a role, showing that warmer months often led to higher sales in certain regions.

- **Data for 2008 was incomplete**, with the dataset only covering part of the year. This impacted the overall view of 2008’s performance, but it still provided valuable insights into trends.

## Final Thoughts
This project was about taking raw, messy data and turning it into something useful for the business. By looking at sales, customer behavior, and regional performance, we were able to make smarter decisions about how we should move forward. The insights from this analysis helped us better understand where we were excelling and where we needed to adjust.

If you’re looking to make more informed decisions about your business, this kind of analysis can help point you in the right direction. It’s not just about the numbers—it’s about understanding what those numbers are really telling you.
